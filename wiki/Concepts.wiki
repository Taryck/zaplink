= ZAPLink Main Concepts =
To use ZAPLink features you don't need to understand all ZAPLink concepts. However this might helps you if you have a bug to hunt down.
Undestanding ZAPLink concepts his required for :
  * Connector devlopers
  * Devlopers that use ZAPLink components (eg : for combining features)

Here are the ZAPLink Main Concepts :
  * File (ZAPLINK_FILE) : Object that handle file managment
  * Component (ZAPLINK_COMPONENT) : Object that identify ABAP component fully. It also might contain a sub component list.
  * Container (ZAPLINK_CONTAINER) : Object that handle container actions such has adding or removing components from the container.
  * [Connector Connector] (ZAPLINK_OBJECT, ZAPLINK_PACKAGE, `...` ) : Objects that implements ZAPLINK_CONNECTOR interface. This implementation allow the container to convert a ABAP component to XML file (or raw content).
  * List (ZAPLINK_LIST) : Object that contains a set of distinct component.
  
= ZAPLink Minor Concepts =
Several other more minor concepts also exists :
  * Options (ZAPLINK_OPTIONS) : Objects that contains Basic options as follow.
  * Devlopment class options (ZAPLINK_OPT_DEVCLASS) : Object that handle rules to applie to package
  * Transport request options (ZAPLINK_OPT_DEVCLASS) : Object that handle rules to applie to transport request

All this concepts could be extended by inheriting from ZAPLink object.
