Features enhancement are possible like :
	# *XML cleaning* : To remove useless attributs such as change date and author, to allow easier delta analyse.
    # *Checksum* : Add a MD5 checksum on xml. If checksum has change this means that component has changed.
	# Container in zip file : to preserver storage space. [https://code.google.com/p/zaplink/source/browse/CLAS/CLAS.ZAPLINK_FILE_ZIP.xml Download Class ZAPLINK_FILE_ZIP]
    # Many others will rise from ZAPLink devloper group or from you...

	# *Combine ZAPLink features* together or with you own development to provide *new features with added values*.
	# *Combine ZAPLink extensions* together to provide *new features with added values*.
	
= Exemples =
== Mass Extractor ==
To use repository capabilities of [http://mercurial.selenic.com/ Merciruial] provided by Google code, we have to convert ABAP component of this framework to files.
If we add to do it one by one it will takes too much times, and we might miss some change. ZAPLink extractor allow you to create one file per ABAP component and save it to file. Local file is changed only if ABAP component has changed.
This tools use ZAPLink features :
  * Basic version
    # Export ABAP components from SAP systems to files
  * Extended version
    # XML cleaning : To remove useless components such as change date and author, to allow easier delta analyse.
    # Checksum : Add a MD5 checksum on xml. If checksum has change this means that component has changed.
  * it's own feature
    # Create local directories
[Tools Tools provided to developpers] are build on ZAPLink framework.
