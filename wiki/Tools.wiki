This development tools is used to interface SAP with Google code.

To use repository capabilities of [http://mercurial.selenic.com/ Mercurial] (provided by Google code), we have to convert ABAP component of this framework to files.

If we add to do it one by one it will takes too much times, and we might miss some change. So ZAPLink extractor has been build in 1 day to allow you to create one file per ABAP component and save it to local files. This local files are changed only if his ABAP component has changed.

This tools use the following ZAPLink features :
  * *Basic* version
    # Export ABAP components
  * *Extentions*
    # XML cleaning
    # Checksum
  * it's own feature
    # Create local directories
