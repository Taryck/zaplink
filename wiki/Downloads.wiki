= ZAPLink extractor =
Need ZAPLink basic framework. *No container yet created* because reserved to developers.
This application allow to extract ABAP component to XML File. One component into one file. Also detecting ABAP component change based on a checksum of XML content.
This tools allow you to save all your developments (Classes, programs, custo, ...) to prevent developments loss due to :
  * Accidental deletion of component
  * Component overwrited by transport request
  * Devlopment system failure that require restoration (last week save)

= Customer SGEN =
Need ZAPLink basic framework. *No container yet created*.
This application allow you to run SGEN of customer specific devlopments. This is usefull on intergation system to ensure that a transport resquest (with Code 0) do not invalidate other components not in this transport request.
Eg : when changing a method from public to private the transported component is OK (transport request has RC = 0) but all users of this method will no longer compile. Using SGEN after each bacth of transport request will ensure that all customer specific component compile.
